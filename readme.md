# Junk Buster

This project's goal is to build a robust machine learning model capable of classifying emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). This is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and a great way to solidify your understanding of text-based classification.

## Skills Reinforced

Working through this project will help you strengthen the following key skills:

* **Text Preprocessing:** Learn how to clean and prepare raw email text for machine learning. This includes techniques like **tokenization** (breaking text into words), **stemming** (reducing words to their root form), and **lemmatization** (reducing words to their base form).
* **Feature Engineering:** Understand how to transform text data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand. You'll specifically work with **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, a powerful method for weighing word importance.
* **Classification Algorithms:** Gain practical experience with common machine learning algorithms used for classification, such as **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**. You'll learn to train these models and evaluate their performance.

## Python Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are essential for this project:

* **`scikit-learn`**: A comprehensive library for machine learning, providing tools for model training, evaluation, and various preprocessing steps.
* **`nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. You'll use it for advanced text preprocessing.

## Dataset

This project utilizes publicly available spam datasets. Good sources include platforms like [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv), which host numerous datasets specifically designed for spam detection challenges. You'll need to acquire and preprocess a suitable dataset before training your model.
